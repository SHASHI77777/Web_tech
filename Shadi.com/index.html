                    <p> <strong>Dating 101</strong>: When on a date, switch off your phone. Nothing is more insulting to
                        a girl than a man answering every call while on a date. You are allowed to make a small deal
                        about turning off your phone at the start of the date with a comment like "Now we will not be
                        disturbed". Power down your phone or lose your date. Can't have both.</p>

                    <p><strong>Dating 102</strong>: Leave your ego at home. A lot of guys are too sensitive. If she
                        giggles because you made a small mistake, instead of getting angry or defensive, try laughing at
                        yourself. Remember she is as nervous as you are (or more!) and it could just be her nerves
                        showing. <br>
                        Another ego issue is your treatment of people around you. Waiters, valet, taxi drivers, or cooks
                        may not follow your instructions. Your interaction with these people will show her how you will
                        act with her when the newness has worn out. Always be kind, generous, and forgiving. (that last
                        one is something we should all aspire to all the time).</p>
